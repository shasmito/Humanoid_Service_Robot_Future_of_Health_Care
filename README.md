The healthcare sector’s lack of focus on technological innovations has created new opportunities to enhance service
robots that can assist patients in dealing with their illnesses and
providing better solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as
a catalyst for developing service robots in the healthcare sector
to overcome the difficulties and hardships caused by this virus.
Humanoid Service Robots are advantageous as they not only
prevent the spread of infection and reduce human error but
also allow front-line staff to reduce direct contact, focusing their
attention on higher-priority tasks and creating separation from
direct exposure to infection. Robots have been used to perform
tasks that would otherwise put healthcare workers at risk, such
as delivering medicine, food and supplies to patients in isolation.
